Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit you as a full-stack web developer.

Your task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Youâ€™ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Because this application wonâ€™t be deployed, youâ€™ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria being met. Youâ€™ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the readme of your project.![13-orm-homework-demo-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69323735/136336495-096eb801-b12f-49a1-9fd8-9d5e24a94228.gif)
